               <h2> Who is a Front-end Developer? </h2><p> 
                Experienced coder. A person not afraid of math and statistics. 
                Someone who is able to implement design through various programming languages. All these descriptions can go for a good front-end developer. But who really is this software professional whose work we can see literally everywhere on the Internet and without whom we wouldn't be able to enjoy our favorite websites the way we do? It's someone with extensive knowledge of technologies like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Someone who gives you (a user) the opportunity to interact with the website and website applications directly. And finally, someone that makes sure you can open up and browse the site on any device or in any browser and the information will still be relevant and easy to read. <br> <br> <br>
</p>
              <h2> What does a Front-end Developer do?</h2><p> 
Compared to a back-end developer, who works mainly "behind the scenes" and is responsible for the creation of systems that make the website/application work properly, your role as a front-end developer will be to ensure that the designs created by web designers will appear as they're supposed to. You'll also spend some time analyzing and fixing the bugs and making sure there are no errors on the front-end. As mentioned above, front-end developers are also in charge of adjusting the site to other devices and browsers. In addition, tasks such as code testing and producing new user-facing features might occur among your job responsibilities.
